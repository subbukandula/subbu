1) Header MaNIPULATION : COOKIES
2) Cookie Security: overly broad path


 a web application under telekom.net/meineAnwendung/index.jsp sets a cookie with the path "; path = /". The cookie is then sent with all requests to the domain telekom.net, possibly at other, less trusted applications that have been placed in the root or in any other directories.
 
If the path, however, to "; path = / myApp /", the cookie is sent only with requests to domain.org/myApp/ (and also by all of the underlying sub-directories, but not overlying directories). The final slash character must not be omitted because the cookie is otherwise sent to other directories with matching names, z. B. to telekom.net/meineAnwendung-exploited.
 
If no path is specified, the browser uses as default the path of the current HTTP request, based on which the cookie was set.
Motivation: A restrictive use of the "path" attribute prevents the session cookie is sent to other Web applications.

There is issue with this that i am facing 
Say cookie path is set to "/Support"
if user requests as "www.domain.com/support" the cookie is not available. Only if request is "www.domain.com/Support" the cookie can be read. 
Couldn't find soln in whole net. It is highly appreciable if any soln to this problem
